Description: Annual aerial and ground survey data detecting forest insect and
disease damage across US Forest Service regions. Polygons represent areas of
observed tree mortality, defoliation, and other damage.
Format: Geodatabase (.gdb), 10 regional files
Spatial coverage: All USFS regions (R1-R6, R8-R10; R7 merged into R6 in 1965)
  - CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii
Temporal coverage: 1997-2024
Download date: 2025-01-29

Original CRS (varies by region):
  - CONUS (R1-R6, R8-R9): USA_Contiguous_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic_USGS_version
  - Alaska (R10): NAD83 / Alaska Albers
  - Hawaii (R5-HI): Hawaii Albers Equal Area Conic
Cleaned output CRS: EPSG:4326 (WGS84)

Feature counts (raw):
  - DAMAGE_AREAS_FLAT: 4,475,827 polygons
  - DAMAGE_POINTS_FLAT: 1,243,890 points
  - SURVEYED_AREAS_FLAT: 74,505 polygons
